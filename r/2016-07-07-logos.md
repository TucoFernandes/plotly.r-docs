### New to Plotly?

Plotly's R library is free and open source!<br>
[Get started](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/) by downloading the client and [reading the primer](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/).<br>
You can set up Plotly to work in [online](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#hosting-graphs-in-your-online-plotly-account) or [offline](https://plot.ly/r/offline/) mode.<br>
We also have a quick-reference [cheatsheet](https://images.plot.ly/plotly-documentation/images/r_cheat_sheet.pdf) (new!) to help you get started!

### Version Check

Version 4 of Plotly's R package is now [available](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/#installation)!<br>
Check out [this post](http://moderndata.plot.ly/upgrading-to-plotly-4-0-and-above/) for more information on breaking changes and new features available in this version.

```r
library(plotly)

### Embed Logos on a Graph


```r
library(plotly)

p <- plot_ly(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(1, 2, 3)) %>%
  add_lines() %>%
  layout(
    images = list(
      list(source = "https://images.plot.ly/language-icons/api-home/python-logo.png",
           xref = "paper",
           yref = "paper",
           x= 0,
           y= 1,
           sizex = 0.2,
           sizey = 0.2,
           opacity = 0.8
      ),
